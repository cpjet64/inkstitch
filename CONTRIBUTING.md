We're so happy you're interested in contributing to Ink/Stitch!  There's a lot that we need help with for people with all skill levels and backgrounds.

Before you contribute, **please have a look at our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.  Thanks!

It is the canonical source for:

* CI/CD and release expectations
* debug and docs workflows

Companion documents:

If you're looking for ideas, consider this list:

* coding (Python, Javascript)

  * we need someone to figure out how we can start code-signing our application
* translations ([LOCALIZATION.md](LOCALIZATION.md))

  * closing completed issues
  * prioritizing bugs and features
